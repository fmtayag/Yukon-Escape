Hello, there! Thank you very much for downloading my entry for the 2-Buttons Jam, Yukon Escape! I hope you enjoy the game!

What is this game?
Yukon Escape is a sidescroller game where you try to dodge obstacles and try to survive as long as possible. It is set in the Yukon mountains where an avalanche is hurtling towards you, launching debris and generating unstable tectonics! Try to dodge all of them...or you can be a daredevil and try to get points by narrowly missing them!

This game is my entry to the 2-Buttons Jam 2020 on itch.io
